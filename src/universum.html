                                Talent Radar was initially designed as the Heroku-based marketing system for creating

                                can import data, filter subscribers, and schedule send-outs at a specific time and date.

                                include the ability to track campaign execution progress, restart on fail, campaign A/B
                                testing, and real-time campaign

                                app, and a Java-written plugin for Elasticsearch. All of them were communicating via

                        One of the primary objectives was to improve the survey system that offers respondents (both
                        students and professionals)
                        to take a survey to determine their archetype (Leader, Internationalist, Idealist, Hunter,
                        Harmonizer, Entrepreneur or
                        Careerist). After passing the survey, a respondent is redirected to their page to see
                        career-related information based
                        on the survey results, e.g., the best employer to choose, the average salary in a specific
                        field, etc.

                    <p class="challenges__col">
                        <span>The main challenge</span> was that the system relied on a paid third-party service with a
                        custom API
                        using prediction.io.
                        Because of it, processing queries took a lot more time than it was supposed to. Also, there was
                        a problem updating the
                        recommendation system: new data could be imported only in manual mode.

                            allowed our client to
